Qi Namespace information
========================

.. toctree::
   Qi_Namespaces_API


A Qi tenant is divided into one or more Namespaces. Each Namespace is a logical entity 
within a tenant and holds its own set of Qi Types, Qi Streams, and Qi Stream Behaviors.
For more information see `Qi namespaces API <https://qi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Qi_Namespaces_API.html>`__.

Within a Qi Tenant you must have at least one Namespace in which to work.
You may create up to five namespaces within a tenant. If you use all five of your namespaces 
and want to create another, you can first delete an existing namespace and then create a new one. 
Contact OSIsoft if you require more than five namespaces within a tenant.

The following table shows the required and optional Qi namespace properties:
