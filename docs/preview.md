Qi preview
##########

Qi is currently in a closed preview phase. During the preview the 
Qi service is being made available to a select number of customers 
to use the service and to provide feedback. Please keep the following 
in mind during this preview phase:

-  We want your feedback. Send questions, suggestions, and ideas to
   `QiSupport@osisoft.com <mailto:%20QiSupport@osisoft.com>`__. The Qi 
   team will update you with additional ways to provide feedback as
   they become available.
-  The samples and documentation will likely change; be sure to check back
   here periodically.
-  The preview offering is not recommended for use with production environments.
-  The service might become unavailable at times. If this happens, the Qi team 
   will attempt to inform preview users and restore availability as soon as possible.
-  The Qi team will work to avoid data loss; however, it might become necessary
   during this phase of service operation. The Qi team will inform you as soon as
   possible if data loss occurs.
